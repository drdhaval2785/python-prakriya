Usage
=====

To use prakriya in a project::

    >>> from prakriya import Prakriya
    >>> p = Prakriya()

If you are using the library the first time, be patient.
This will take a long time, because the data file (30 MB) is being downloaded.

If you can spare around 600 MB space, It is highly recommended to decompress the tar.gz first time.
Subsequent actions will be very fast. This is one time requirement.
If the data is not decompressed, the code will read from tar.gz file every time.
It introduces slowness to a great extent. So highly recommended to decompress.

    >>> p.decompress()

Now you are ready to roll!

The generic format for usage is as follows:

    >>> p[verbform, field]

``verbform`` is mandatory. It is the verb form to be investigated.
The input should be in SLP1 encoding.

``field`` is optional.

Actual usage examples will be like the following.

    >>> p['Bavati']
    >>> p['Bavati', 'prakriya']
    >>> p['Bavati', 'verb']
